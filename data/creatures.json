    "description": "It is one of the fastest swimming jellies. They are very good at escaping. They have stinging cells (nematocysts) that capture prey and make them unappetizing. The bell of the jelly can radiate blue light to startle predators. When threatened, the bell transforms shape into a tube shape and its tentacles straighten to be able to propel itself forward. They drop sticky tentacles to confuse predators as they flee."

    "description": "They are covered in tiny pigment sacs called chromatophores, which when closed, makes their skin translucent. They have buoyant bodies because they have a large sac filled with ammonium (lighter than seawater). Their opaque body parts, like their eyes, glow at the same intensity as the sunlight through the water to hide them. This is possible because they have special light organs called photophores. They have large eyes and extremely good eyesight."
